Progressive Piano provides a modern way of playing virtual-piano based sheets on your computer keyboard, offering support for.txt sheets.

# What is Progressive Piano?
Progressive Piano (or PPiano for short) is an application with a clean user interface that allows you to interact with virtual piano sheets through your keyboard responses, making it usable for learning purposes.

# Branches
Progressive Piano is being developed using a two-branch system to guarantee a clean acknowledgement of the functionality for all users.

- `singlekey` - **Recommended for basic users.** This is the most stable and recommended branch, still in development.
- `multikey` - **Not recommended for casual use.** This branch will have the latest features, still in development.
